## Disclaimer

These userscripts are designed to improve workflow and usability in Canvas.  
They don’t access, store, or modify any student data.  
They’re shared as-is — I’ve tested them, but I can’t guarantee they’ll work perfectly in every environment.  
Use them at your own discretion.

## Credits

Some scripts were written by me, others were adapted with help from AI tools (ChatGPT / Claude), and a few come from the Canvas Community or former contributors.  
Credit is included where known.
